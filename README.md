# 👋 Hi, I’m Fredrick Aminto

Welcome to my GitHub profile portfolio!  
This repository is the home for my **personal projects**, **portfolio site**, and **CV** — giving you a snapshot of what I do and what I’m passionate about.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m an **AI & Data Science undergraduate** with experience and interests in:

- **Python** programming  
- **Power BI** & data visualization  
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**  
- Software development and real-world engineering applications  

Here you’ll find work that reflects both what I’ve built for coursework and projects that highlight my technical skills and curiosity.
